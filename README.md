# Time Series Analysis
Wallmart Sales Forecasting

##Objective: 
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust predictive model capable of forecasting weekly sales for Walmart's 45 stores. By leveraging historical data, we aim to create a tool that can effectively anticipate sales patterns, thereby enabling the company to make informed decisions to enhance its supply chain management, optimize inventory levels, cater to higher product demand, manage store footfall, and strategically implement markdowns.

##Importance: 
The accurate prediction of future weekly sales has significant implications for Walmart's operational efficiency and profitability. Efficiently managing the supply chain becomes paramount as it enables the company to streamline its inventory and logistics processes. Optimizing inventory levels based on accurate sales forecasts ensures that the right products are available at the right time and in the right quantities. This, in turn, prevents stockouts and excess inventory, reducing costs and improving customer satisfaction. Additionally, with insights from accurate sales predictions, Walmart can strategically manage store traffic, allocate resources, and plan markdowns to optimize revenue and customer engagement.

##Motivation: 
Forecasting sales is a quintessential task in the realm of data science, playing a pivotal role in decision-making across various industries. This project provides a valuable opportunity to apply and experiment with a range of data science techniques and algorithms on real-world data. By delving into this project, we can gain insights into the nuances of handling extensive datasets, exploring data patterns, selecting appropriate machine learning algorithms, fine-tuning model parameters, and evaluating model performance. Through this experiential learning process, we can enhance our skills and expertise in the domain of predictive analytics while contributing to a practical business solution for one of the world's largest retailers, Walmart.
